# Hotel Demand Analysis

Introduction
In this project, I used Hotel Booking Demand data which is from the course website. This dataset includes 2097 American visitorâ€™s hotel booking information. The dataset includes 18 variables. There are 6 categorical variables describing booking information of guests such as hotel, arrive date month, meal, market segment, reserved room type, and customer type. Meal indicates the type of meal booked. BB is Bed & breakfast, HB is breakfast and one other meal, FB is breakfast, lunch, and dinner and SC/Undefined indicates no meal package. Market segment has two types: Online TA, TO, direct, corporate, and groups. TA means Travel Agents and TO means Tour Operator. Customer type has four different types: Contract, group, transient, transient party. There are also 13 categorical variables including the value indicating if the booking was canceled, the number of days between booking date and arrival date, year of the arrival date, day of the arrival date, week number of the arrival date, the number of stays in weekend nights, the number of satay in weeknights, number of adults, children, and babies, average daily rate, a total of special requests.
